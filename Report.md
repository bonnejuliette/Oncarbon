## In-room hot water consumption for an ecological footprint calculation of a hotel

To evaluate the impact of hot water consumption on the overall ecological footprint of a hotel stay, several data components should be considered as an input to the calculation model:
- First of all, a data point which should be used as a general value for the calculation model for the ecological footprint of a hotel is a hotel capacity and occupancy rate. This would allow us to deduce the ecological footprint per hotel stay per person/per room for all the related components in the model.
- Overall water consumption per room: this can be deduced, based on total hotel annual/monthly water consumption per number of rooms/bed places in the establishment. Due to variations in the hot water consumption depending on the season, monthly data might be more appropriate. This way, we can also account for the room related services and maintenance, such as cleaning, laundry, etc. (essentially water consumption by the personnel servicing the rooms). This way, the model shall be generalised easier when evaluating hotels of various categories, facilities and in-hotel services.
- Total electricity consumption per room: same approach can be used, as when calculating the water consumption. According to the white paper funded by The Energy Foundation [1] U.S. national water-related energy use accounts for 13% of the nation’s electricity consumption, which corresponds to 5% of their carbon emissions. When considering a residential (or if we want to be more precise, hospitality) sector, a more fitting coefficient should be defined to identify the share of the electricity consumption used for water heating alone.  However, this component will have an additional complexity depending on the primary energy source used by the establishment. Depending on the heating technology and the energy resource the related carbon emissions might vary (https://www.iea.org/reports/heating).
These are the main components, which seem appropriate for such a calculation model. Nevertheless, it can be expanded when taking into the account wether the hotel (rather more applicable for hotel chains, perhaps) utilises any low impact water related development schemes, for instance water conservation and water and energy efficiency practices. Also the building construction and the technology used alongside with the renovation performed in a timely manner has a considerable impact on the water and energy efficiency.


## Dataset
1. Hotel capacity and occupancy rates
UN World Tourism Organisation provides some basic tourism statistics: https://www.unwto.org/statistic/basic-tourism-statistics
For example, from the `TOURISM INDUSTRIES` section we can download relevant indicators for accommodation for visitors in hotels and similar establishments in `.xlsx` format.  Indicators include values per country on number of establishments, number of rooms, number of bed-places, occupancy rates and average length of stay for the years 1995-2019.
The file can be easily converted to `.csv` format with the use of gnumeric tools: `ssconvert unwto-tourism-industries-data.xlsx unwto-tourism-industries-data.csv`.
With the help of [tsv-utils](https://github.com/eBay/tsv-utils) by running `csv2tsv` command, `.csv` can be easily converted to `.tsv`. `TSV` file can be later on manipulated to create a suitable dataset format. For example, we can select the relevant indicators by running `tsv-select -f 4,6,11-35 unwto-tourism-industries-data.tsv > unwto-tourism-industries-data-formatted.tsv`. Both `.csv` and `.tsv` formats can be used as a machine-readable input to be later on converted into a `.json` structure of your choice, which is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications.

2. Water and electricity consumption
When in comes to finding data resources for water and electricity consumption in hotels, I would first browse through their environmental reports to scan for relevant data. However, even in bigger hotel chains while the financial reports are usually publicly available, there are currently no strict requirements to disclouse environmental data in hospitality industry [4]. The ways to approach this issue, I would suggest to first of all, reach out to bigger hotel chains and request the data from them, if available and they are ready to share. Otherwise, we can utilize the residential sector data in a respective country and approximate that the water and energy consumtion along with the corresponding GHG emissions shall be somewhat similar for those two sectors. Databases such as [eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) contain comprehensive tables on environment and energy indicators in `.tsv` format.

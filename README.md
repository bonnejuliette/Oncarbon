## Task description
Imagine we are now developing a versatile and scalable climate footprint calculation for hotels.

We’ve identified that in-room hot water consumption should be one of the many components in our calculation model.

Your task consists of three parts, outlined below.

1. How should the in-room hot water component of our model work? What should it look like? Why? Should it work as a fully independent component or have interdependencies to other components of the model?

2. Based on your decisions in the previous step, gather relevant data from sources that you deem good for this purpose. Justify why you chose the sources you did and note which sources you used. Feel free to make a sensible demarcation of the amount of data you gather, since this is just an exercise; a small subset of everything you would gather in the actual job is enough.

3. Manipulate the data you gathered into a format that could be easily machine-used with a programming language. Explain how the format you chose could be used, and why this is a good approach.

Throughout, we are interested in seeing the way you approach the problem and hearing the thoughts you think as you do the work! So please, note that somewhere in the margins or between the lines. There shouldn’t be much reason to use over 4-5 hours to complete the task, and we will take this into account when we look at our work.

Your submission of this task can take the form of a report (text, maybe images) plus a file (or files) you devised in step three, or something else you deem as a good way of representing your work. Github is fine, too.
